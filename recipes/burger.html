        <ul>
            <strong>Ingredients</strong>
            <li>Olive oil (for pan)</li>
            <li>300g Ground beef</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>4 Slices of cheese</li>
            <li>4 Brioche buns</li>
            <li>Ketchup, mayonnaise, shredded iceberg lettuce, and dill pickle slices (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            Preperation
            <li>Heat a cast-iron pan or large heavy skillet over medium-high until very hot, about 2 minutes, then lightly brush with olive oil. Divide ground beef into 4 equal portions (do not form patties).</li>
            <li>Working in batches if needed, place portions on griddle and smash flat with a spatula to form 4"-diameter patties (craggy edges are your friend). Season liberally with salt and cook, undisturbed, until outer edges are brown, about 2 minutes. Flip patties, season with salt, and place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Cook until cheese droops and burgers are medium-rare, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Serve patties on rolls with ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, and pickles and demolish those burgerers</li>
        </ol>
